# SmartEdu AI - About project
This project contains smart computer vision for detecting peoples and their phons, which can help track cheating on important exams or, in the future, in classes so that the younger generation learns to think independently. More about the idea - [LinkedIn Post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7428188032777986048/)

## Contains
- Computer vision (Train on one's own dataset & ultralytics library)
- ML model for predicting calibrated confidence for optimization detecting (LightGBM)
- Frontend (Next.js / SSR, TailwindCSS)
- Backend (FastAPI with Clean Archeticture, Websockets for real-time detecting, alembic for recording results)
- Database (PostgreSQL for memorization students, teachers, comments)
